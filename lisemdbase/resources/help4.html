<p><strong>Infiltration parameters from pedotransfer functions</strong></p>
<p>Soil hydrological parameters are saturated hydraulic conductivity (Ksat in mm/h), porosity (-), and matrix suction at the wetting front (in cm). These are calculated from sand, silt and clay fractions, organic matter fraction, gravel content and bulk density. The pedotransfer functions of Saxton and Rawls (2006) are used for this. Also soil cohesion is derived from the clay fraction.</p>
<p>Soilgrids.org of ISRIC provides texture, org matter and other variables at 250m resolution and 6 layers of soil depth for the whole world. In the interface you can choose the layer and the information will be downloaded, reprojected, resampled to the desired gridsize and stored in the <strong>base</strong> folder. These maps have missing values for urban areas and water bodies. The interface fills in these missing values by interpolating from the edge of a missing value inward, using inverse distance interpolation. Everything is done for two layers in the soil, which assumes you use the two layer Green and Ampt infiltration option in LISEM. If you only use a 1 layer G&amp;A infiltration the second layer maps are simply ignored.</p>
<p>The soil depth is derived from the DEM and river mask, assuming that steeper areas have thinner soil, and flat areas close to the river have thicker soils. Als there is a relation between slope convexity (thicker) and concavity (thinner). This empirical method gives a soil depth between 0 and 1, which is than recalculated to the minimum and maximum depth given in the interface. The minimum depth is also the depth of the root zone (top soil - soildep1.map) while the second layer (sub soil &ndash; soildep2.map) ranges from the minimum depth to the maximum depth given.</p>
<p><em>Factors influencing soil physical parameters</em></p>
<ul>
<li><em>Do not include gravel effect</em>: gravel in the pedotransfer functions decreases the Ksat and porosity. The gravel estimates in Soilgrids.org are rather high so this option is to simply ignore gravel in the functions. This will increase Ksat and porosity slightly</li>
<li><em>Use reference bulk density</em>: a standard bulk density of approximately 1350 kg/m<sup>3</sup> is assumed by Saxton and Rawls (2006). Using a higher standard bulk density will decrease Ksat and porosity (density factor &gt; 1), a lower value will increase these variables (density factor &lt; 1). You can use this for calibration.</li>
<li><em>Include density factor from land use</em>: the pedotransfer functions include a density factor where 1.0 is the normal density, with a range of 0.for a very loose soil up to 1.1 for a compacted soil. the density factor of column 5 in the land use table is also applied, on top of the other factors. This allows the user to influence Ksat and porosity with land use.</li>
<li><em>Initial moisture content</em>: the pedotransfer functions estimate not only porosity, but also the moisture content at field capacity and at wilting point. The user has to set the initial moisture content at the start of a LISEM run (maps thetai1.map and thetai2.map). The range of initial moisture content can be varied between wilting point (very dry) and porosity (fully saturated soil), where a value of 0 is fields capacity, -1 is field capacity and +1 is porosity. For instance a value of 0.5 will give an initial moisture content half-way between field capacity and porosity.</li>
</ul>
<p>NOTE: in LISEM literature initial moisture content is always noted as very sensitive, because the model was event based. So a high initial moisture content causes less infiltration and a lot of runoff. When running LISEM in continuous mode, there may still be some runoff at the start with a high moisture content, but this will change according to the water balance calculations in the model. The effect of the initial moisture content is only noticeable in the beginning of a run. One of these effects may be that if you assume a very wet initial moisture content and you select to use baseflow in LISEM, the water from the soil will percolate towards the groundwater and become baseflow shortly after. A very dry start of LISEM will not have this percolation, therefore not have a groundwater build-up and no baseflow in the beginning.</p>
