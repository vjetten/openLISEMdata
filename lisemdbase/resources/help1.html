<p><strong>CWC India - openLISEM database generator</strong></p>
<p>This program generates a database for openLISEM by calling a python script.</p>
<p>There are two interface pages:</p>
<p>1 - The input and output directories and main fiels</p>
<p>2 - The basic options for the catchment database</p>
<p>A configuration file (lisemdbaseoptions.cfg) is generated automatically in your temp directory that is used by the python script.</p>
<p><strong>Ini project files</strong></p>
<p>The database also saves the options in a "ini" file, and ini files can be saved for each project. These are saved in the program folder at the start, and as you add more project ini files.</p>
<p>You can save the current interface configuration (save button), or save the current config under a new name (save as) and open the explorer to load a previous ini file. These are added to the dropdown list at the top.</p>
<p><strong>CONDA environment</strong></p>
<p>It is assumed that python, PCRaster, GDAL and other software is installed using mini conda or anaconda. In order to work, a conda environment must be created with the following commands:</p>
<ol>
<li class="code"><em>conda create --name lisem python</em></li>
<li class="code"><em>conda activate lisem</em></li>
<li class="code"><em>conda install -c conda-forge pcraster owslib scipy gdal</em></li>
<li class="code"><em>pip install osgeo</em></li>
</ol>
<p>This will create a conda environment 'lisem' which is used to run the database generation script. "lisem" is an example name, you can choose something else. The lisemdbase application scans for all possible conda environments and warns of it cannot find any of the necessary libs. If you use Spyder, Jupyter noteboork etc. you have to add additional libs. This is outside the scope of this project.</p>
<p>The conda environments are stored in a dropdown list and you can choose which one you use when running the python script.&nbsp; </p>
<p><strong>Maps and Folders<br /></strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Python dbase script - lets you select the latest openLISEM DBase script</li>
<li>openLISEM Maps folder - the <em>output</em> folder that contains all maps that openLISEM needs. Default names are used.</li>
<li>Base data input folder - the folder that has the domain maps. The downloaded SOILGRIDS.ORG texture maps will be stored here as well.</li>
<li>DEM and channel mask maps, the minimum maps that the script needs. Default names are dem0.map and channel0.map, feel free to use your own names.</li>
<li>Optional: a user defined outlet map to force the outlet to a given location. Sometimes the lowest point ius not at the ddge of the map. If you have a map with an outlet point defined you can add it here (point has the value one, the rest should be 0). Do not enter intermediate observation points in the river here, only the outlet of the catchment. </li>
<li>Optional: a map with dams, where the dam areas have a negative value which is the dem storage in meters, e.g. -10 means that all cells in the dam have 10 meter of water storage available</li>
<li>ESPG number - the number of the cartographic projection of all output map. Note that the PCRaster maps will have this projection and grdisize, but the cartographic projection information is NOT STORED in the header of PCRaster maps. See also: https://www.spatialreference.org/ref/epsg/</li>
<li>LULC folder: the folder that contains the GeoTiff LULC map containing the area (can be alrger)</li>
</ul>
