<p><strong>CWC India - openLISEM database generator</strong></p>
<p><strong>Options</strong></p>
<p>Note: not all maps have to be generated each time you run the script. If you run it for the first time, select everything. Once all SOILGRIDS data are downloaded, you do not have to do that again (sometimes the connection with the soilgrids server crashes, just try again).</p>
<ul>
<li>DEM derivatives:
<ul>
<li>Catchment size threshold for the PCRaster <code>lddcreate </code>command, in case multiple catchments exist (def 1.0e10)</li>
<li>optional pits are filled up to a certain size using a threshold value for the PCRaster <code>lddcreatedem </code>command, a map &lt;class="code"&gt;demcorr.map is generated for verification (def 1.0e5)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>River network:
<ul>
<li>Generate <strong>channel width</strong> and depth with empirical power functions (Allen and Pavelsky, 2015). The power for the width is set at 0.459 (default). To match the generated river width with reality, give the estimated river witdh in the box below in m (e.g. measured from google earth).</li>
<li><strong>Channel depth</strong> is generated from the width with a power function, the default value for the poer is 0.3. To match the depth with relaty, give an estimated depth in the box (in m). Use the dry bed depth, so without baseflow.</li>
<li><strong>Prune 1 cell</strong> from the river network branches: sometimes single cell branches are generated which are deleted.</li>
<li><strong>User defined outlets </strong>force the outlet in the right location (def name outlet0.map). If you do not use this option, the endpoint in the LDD will be used (generally the lowest point in the domain). The outlet should have a value of 1, the rest 0. Multiple outlets can be defined when you create a database of multiple catchments. NOTE: the outlet should be a cell in the channel map, which is sometimes different from the real world location of the outlet (when thhe channel map is constructed from the DEM).</li>
<li>Adjust the river network to one or more <strong>rainwater buffers or dams</strong>. The map with dams has negative values, which indicate the storage that is possible for each cell (e.g. a value of -10 m will give a storage of 10m multiplied by the cell size for each cell in the dam). De river network (ldd) and all channel maps are adapted to the dam(s).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>LULC data:
<ul>
<li>LULC table is a text file (ludata.tbl) with surface parameters related values for land use classes: the row numbers must correspond to the class numbers in the LULC map (1,2,...n), the column numbers are variables used in openLISEM: <br />1=Random roughness RR (cm) for storage of water in microdepressions; 2 = manning's n (flow resistance); 3 = plant height (m) used for splash detachment; 4 = average canopy cover fraction (-), 5 is bulkdensity factor (0.9-1.2) used in pedotransfer functions, 6 = SMAX equation nr (1-7) for interception storage. <br /><strong><br />The LULC table is loaded in the 3rd tabwhere you can edit the values!</strong><br /><br /></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Include SOILGRIDS data:
<ul>
<li>if you have not downloaded soil data from SOILGRIDS.ORG do this once. The data layers are stored in the base directory for future use. Select a layer depth for the first soil layer and for the second soil latyer (6 depths are available). The data is provided by <a href="https://www.isric.org/">ISRIC</a>. NOTE: You need an internet connection for this option! Sometime the server disconnects and you have to try again.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Infiltration parameters:
<ul>
<li>pedotransfer functions by Saxton and Rawls (2006) are used to generate Ksat, porosity, initial moisture content and wetting front suction for infiltration, for 2 layers.</li>
<li>Soildepth is generated from the DEM. The depth of the first layer (the root zone) is contant, give the value in m.</li>
<li>Use a reference buldensity (def 1350 kg/m3): the pedotrabnsfer functions assume a standard bulkdensity, making this bulkdensity lower will results in a looser soil with a higher Ksat, giving a higher value results in a lower Ksat (denser soil).</li>
<li>Initial moisture content at the start of the openLISEM run. Default value is Field Capacity (0). A value between -1 and 0 scales the initial moisture between Wilting Point and Field Capacity, between 0 and +1 scales the values between Field Capacity and Porosity.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Erosion paramneters:
<ul>
<li>Derive Soil Cohesion from the clay content fo the soil.</li>
<li>Sediment transport needs the median of the texture D50 for suspended matter calculations, and the upper 90% quantile D90 for bedload transport. These can be estimated assuming that the texture percentages represent the cumulative density distribution for every cell. A log-linear regression is done&nbsp;<em>for every cell</em> (can be slow depending on catchment size).</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
