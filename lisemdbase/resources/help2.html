<p><strong>Catchment delineation and flow network</strong></p>
<p>Three maps are needed as base maps: a DEM, a river mask map and a map with one or more outlet points. These are points signify the end of the river network, not reporting points that you need in the area itself.</p>
<p>In this category DEM related maps are created, such as the overland flow network and slope maps. The overland flow network should be made with PCRaster (ldd.map). It connects the cells from the top of the watershed to the outlet in a network, using the steepest slope. The map is seen as a base map and all maps are checked against this map for valid cells and the flow domain boundary. If you have an error in openLISEM that says that a value is missing while LISEM has an LDD value in this cell., note the row and column number because you likely have missing values in the land use map.</p>
<ul>
<li>The <strong>DEM</strong> should have catchment boundaries, so the values outside the catchment(s) have missing values.</li>
<li>The <strong>river</strong> mask is a map with value &lsquo;1&rsquo; for the river channel and &lsquo;0&rsquo; for the rest of the catchment. LISEM works best if this map is created from the DEM.</li>
<li>If you have multiple <strong>outlets</strong>, the outlet map should be numbered sequentially (1, 2 ..n). The Dbase henerator creates a map with watersheds called ws.map in the maps folder. After generating the dbase, check if the watershed boundaries are correct.</li>
<li>A map should be given with <strong>observation points</strong>, numbered sequentially.&nbsp; If you don't have that you can use the same map as the outlet map. For these points LISEM reports the avg. rainfall, discharge, water height, sediment concentration and sediment flux.</li>
<li>If you have <strong>culverts</strong> this map should have values in the culvert cells that are the maximum discharge of a culvert. A culvert is always in the channel. If you do not have this map, give a map with zero's.</li>
</ul>
<p>These maps in combination with the land use map are the basis of everything.</p>
<p>Options:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Map with dam areas</em>: dams are simulated in LISEM as flat depressions that have an elevation below the surrounding terrain. You must supply a map that for dam cells have a negative value. And the rest of the catchment is 0. A value of for instance -7 means that at the start of the run, the dam/depression has a water level 7 meters below the surrounding DEM and can be filled up with approximately 7 meters, befiore it overflows. For example: if the cell size is 200 m, the storage capacity of <u>one cell</u> is 200x200x7=2800 m<sup>3</sup>. It is logical to assume that all cells belonging to the same dam have the same negative value. Different dams can have different values.<br />The dams must be located to overlap with a part of a river branch. When you select this option the database generator will alter your river network: it will interrupt the river channel and create a temporary outlet in the dam so that the water overflows into the depressions and fills it. Eventually the water will continue in the channel downstream of the dam. <strong>Be aware that all channel maps are altered! You cannot switch the dams on and off in LISEM alone.</strong></li>
<li><em>correct the DEM</em>: for isolated depressions that are deeper than X meter. X is a value given by the user. Some DEMs have single cell depressions (called pits in PCRaster) that do not exit in reality and are usually very deep. LISEM will slow down when these are filled up and water is stagnant in these depressions. You can choose to fill these depressions to X meter below the surrounding values.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Channel network</strong></p>
<p>LISEM needs maps for the channel network, width, depth, manning&rsquo;s n, and bed angle. These are generated from the channel mask and the DEM.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Channel Width</em>: It is assumed that the river channel gradually increases form a start value of 2m width and 1 m depth, to the value as it is measured at the outlet, given by the user in this interface. I for instance you give an outlet value of 147m, the generator will create a &ldquo;<em>map</em>&rdquo;, that increases the channel width from teh start value at the beginning of all branches, to 147m at the outlet. This increase is non-linear. From analyzing channel data of all US rivers, Allen and Pavelsky (2015) found that the increase is non-linear with total river length in m: <br />W = L<sup>0.459</sup>.</li>
<li><em>Channel Depth</em>: the depth supplied is the depth from the terrain elevation to the bottom &nbsp;of the channel (the water depth at bank full condition). Allen and Pavelsky (2015) do not give a relation for channel depth but from earlier LISEM projects we use the equation: D = W<sup>0.3</sup>. The parameters 0.459 and 0.3 can be adjusted if desired.</li>
<li>If you have <em>multiple catchments and multiple outlets</em>, they have a unique sequential number (1, 2, 3 ... n). The table in the interface allows you to give widths and depths for each outlet. The principle is the same as described above.</li>
<li><em>Channel Manning n</em>: the resistance to flow for all channel cells. Can be adjusted by hand later if you so desire.</li>
<li>Channel stationary baseflow: give a value in m3/s at all outlet points in the outlet map. This is the stationary baseflow that is maintained throughout a run. LISEM derives from this value the baseflow in all channel cells.</li>
